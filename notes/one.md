Python originates from Guido van Rossum
Python is an interpreted language, where you have "source code interpereted on the machine."
#We will be using the PEP8 style guide for our code / submissions!

##Java is a compiled language, however, the JVM builds in the concept of interpereting; making it a hybrid language.

Python can be worked with entirely within a terminal.
  To run a .py file from the terminal, ensure  ```#! /usr/bin/python``` is written on the top line of the program. Modify the file to instruct linux it's executable: ```chmod a+x file.py.  Pass the file name to ```python``` command.

In Python, values are not strictly typed. A good example of this is in operations:
``` 2 // 4``` evaluates to ```0```. ```2 / 4``` evaluates to ```0.5```
    // performs interger value math.     / performs float value math. 

Print statements written without ```()``` are a sure indication the code is written in a version of Python < 3.0.
