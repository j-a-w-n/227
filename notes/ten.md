###Functions & Methods

- function ==> "standalone"
- method ==> "belongs to a class"
- for function we define, we must include a docstring
  - `"""This is a docstring, a brief description of the program."""`
- all object have attributes. For example: `print(some_function.__doc__)`
  - prints the docstring of `some_function` becuase print accesses the value of the `__doc__` attribute
-
