---------

- `len()` gives us length of a string
- `[x:y]` slices a string with x beginning at char @ position, y ending but not including position (within string's index)
- Page 73 has a table of string methods.
  `"some string with string value".strmethod()`
  The var, or literal string must be appended with the string method. No arguments.
