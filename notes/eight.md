### Reading INput

- `open()` method takes a file as an input argument and opens for reading by *default*
- `readline()` reads the newline character (`\n`)
- `strip()` str method removes whitespaces from the front & back of a string
  - all String methods on page 73 of textbook
- look at while_file3.py to see a good loop to print from an `open()` file
- `[x:y]` slices do not populate a runtime error if technically out of range
- `[x]` will produce an error if character req'd *is out of range*
- `split()` chunks a large, given string into its individual strings. Splits at whitespace by default
