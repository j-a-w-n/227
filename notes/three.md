- Back to 'Topic Outline' Q&A's  "Probably imp for midterm study
- ```pause()  print() input()``` All methods that'll be helpful for sub. 1 
- ```for``` is useful when we know concretely how long something will take.
  ```while``` is useful for when we don't, but rather have a condition that determines how      long a function will run.
- Heart of submission one: ```
                           if len(sys.argv) > 1:
                            for item in sys.argv:
                             print(item)
                           ```
